Chickpea is grown mostly in Western Asia, Mediterranean basin, South-East Asia, eastern Africa and in some parts of Canada and Australia. Most of the chickpea grown are consumed locally demonstrating its importance in life and livelihood of the local people. Further, being a grain legume, it plays important role in soil fertility and diversifying cereal-based cropping system. Considering its importance, various efforts have been made to develop genomic and genetic resources of chickpea. A number of draft grade genome assemblies and a pan-genome assembly have been generated and genetic variation maps based on sequencing of more than 3000 chickpea genome have generated a large volume of genomic resources and breeding strategies. This database presents graphical scanning of genes, simple sequence repeats, primer sequences and some of the characterized genetic markers altogether or separately along eight chromosomes of chickpea in a single window. The database provides options to find out genes through similarity searches using different genome assemblies including the pangenome. Sequences of 2 kb-long 5â€™ upstream regions of the genes and gene family-wise classifications and the SNP profile of the genes based on resequencing data allow the researchers and application specialist to search and analyze the genes and the genetic marker in a graphical and user-friendly manner.")
